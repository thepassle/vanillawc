## Introduction

Welcome to the vanilla Web Components (WC) organization. This is a collective of independent Open Source devs with one goal. To create, share, and promote the use of completely vanilla WC implementations.

That means: no extra layers of abstraction between the WC spec and the implementations here; no extra dependencies to track, maintain, update; no extra build steps to develop.

If the criticisms of the WC v1 specification are true, that the API to develop vanilla WC is 'too low level', then this group exists to get low level and see what it's all about.


## How to Contribute

If you have built a WC of your own and think it would be a valuable contribution to the org. Create a **Showcase** issue.

If you have a suggestion for a new WC that you'd like to share. Create a **Proposal** issue.

If you have a suggestion or would just like to spark a discussion about WC. Create a **Discussion** issue.


## Recommendations

**DON'T**

- Rely on any additional layers of abstraction (ex polymer, lit)
- Require additional build steps for development (ie prod is OK)
- Attack others (ie [ad hominem][]), keep the conversation civil or you will be banned

**DO**

- Prefix your WC repos with `wc-`
- Encapsulate your code WCs wherever possible.
- Build your components for maximum reuse
- Support Accessibility wherever possible
- Choose copyleft-friendly licenses<sup>1</sup>
- Feel inclined to share your ideas, this is a space for exploration
- Share in whatever capacity you are able, code isn't the only way to contribute
- Have fun
- Make sure to read [Web Component Best Practices](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/best-practices)
